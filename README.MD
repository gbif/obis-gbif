# Joint Strategy and Issues Tracking for OBIS and GBIF Collaboration

### Overview
This repository holds the strategy and issues tracking related to the joint efforts between the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

The collaboration between OBIS and GBIF aims to ensure that biodiversity data, particularly marine biodiversity data, is freely and openly available to support scientific research and decision-making processes. This strategy builds upon the five-year agreement signed by OBIS and GBIF in 2020 and outlines a rolling annual action plan to align their goals and activities.

The joint OBIS-GBIF stretegy can be consulted [here](https://docs.gbif.org/obis-gbif-joint-strategy/en/).

### Background
In 2020, OBIS and GBIF signed a five-year Letter of Agreement that fosters collaboration across a wide range of activities, focusing on both technical and institutional cooperation. This includes:

  - Technical collaboration around data standards, publishing, and processing.
  - Institutional collaboration to build closer relationships between OBIS and GBIF nodes, offer joint training opportunities, and align documentation across both networks.

### About OBIS
The [**Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)**](https://obis.org/) was founded in May 2000 under the Census of Marine Life as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. It now operates as a component of the [**International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE)**](https://iode.org/) programme under the [**Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)**](https://www.ioc.unesco.org/en) of UNESCO.

OBIS aims to serve as the most comprehensive gateway for data and information on the diversity, distribution, and abundance of marine life. Its primary goal is to support Member States in achieving a healthy and resilient ocean ecosystem.

### About GBIF
The [**Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)**](https://www.gbif.org/) was established in September 2001 as a voluntary international collaboration between governments. GBIF provides free and open access to data about all forms of life on Earth.

As per the 2023-2027 Strategic Framework, the mission of GBIF is “to mobilize the data, skills and technologies needed to make comprehensive biodiversity information freely available for science and decisions addressing biodiversity loss and sustainable development.”

## Joint Strategy and Action Plan
This repository documents the shared objectives, issues, and action plans arising from the OBIS-GBIF collaboration. By working together, OBIS and GBIF strive to ensure that marine biodiversity data is accessible through both platforms, advancing scientific research and supporting decision-making for a sustainable future.

The joint Action Plan can be consulted [here](https://docs.gbif.org/obis-gbif-joint-strategy/en/).
